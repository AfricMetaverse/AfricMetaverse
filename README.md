Aferverse will bring to life the Museums of Africa, fashion, culture, politics and even resources in a way that is decentralized and transparent. Unlike other Projects, the platform will allow people to buy lands and develop model African cities to represent what the future cities in Africa could be like. The Land in the Aferverse will be catalogued to represent specific geographical locations on the continent and will reflect their history and culture. The owners and developers of such land can then monetize it however they chose.

The key ideas the project will focus on at stage one is NFTs and a great marketplace.

On the platform, you would be able to buy and sell using the Platforms Native Token AFER. Great Projects like the Indomitable Legends, a project that show cases Africa’s football Legends will be launching on the AferVerse marketplace, followed by the Eden Legends Project, which is another NFT project that will be celebrating Legends from Africa, from a wide variety of backgrounds, music, sports, politics, philanthropy, business, military, history as well as current celebrities and people of impact.


# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Africmetaverse** is a virtual ecosystem that aims to celebrate and promote the history, wealth and creativity of the African continent in a new light.
The goal of this project is to become a beacon and fuel for creativity, cultural and technological innovation on the African continent. The project also aims to celebrate all cultural heritage that originates from the African continent, from music, art, football, politics, science and religion.

**Vision:**
Our vision is to build the largest Afro-centric metaverse and through it provide liquidity to the African market by leveraging available resources, culture and history using blockchain technology. 

**Mission:**
The African heritage is very rich and colorful. Through our platform we aim to be able to bring decentralization, transparency, and accountability to the African continent in sectors such as sports, arts, music and heritage. To do this we aim to build Africa’s largest Metaverse. The platform will host an NFT marketplace where participants can mint and sell their NFTs, virtual lands and countries mimicking the various historic lands on mainland Africa. The marketplace will allow people design and sell afro-centric wares, and trade in goods and services. Host concerts, build their own virtual worlds and play Afro-centric games within the metaverse.


The **AFER token (AFER)** will be the vehicle that enables the whole world to participate in the development and flourishing of the AFricMetaverse. A fuel for innovation and transformation
The AFricMetaverse will use blockchain technology and NFTs to empower creativity, sports, music and technological development with real world impact through multiple applications.

Through the use of **NFTs** and the **AFER** tokens (**AFER**) users will be able to:

    • Interact with all applications: Buy assets, trade, play and exchange with others.
    • Fund individual projects, Vote and fund projects and application that will be build and listed on the AFricMetaverse
    • Staking: The AFER token (AFER) allows for staking , which enables one to passively earn further AFER
    • Fee Capture: 5% of all transaction volume carried out in AFER tokens (Transaction Fees) shall be allocated with 50% to the Staking Pool as rewards for token holders that Stake AFER tokens and 50% to the ''Foundation.''
    • The Foundation: The role of the Foundation is to support the ecosystem, offering grants to incentivize high quality content and production on the platform. The value of the AFricMetaverse will grow through the valuation of all projects and experiences funded by the Foundation thus creating a positive circle that will enable the funding of bigger and better projects.

# **Road Map**
The **AFricMetaverse** has a strong project roadmap and team to deliver a strong vision to build a unique virtual ecosystem where project owners can build and monetize their creative experiences that will enable a real world impact and allows people from around the world to experience the wealth, depth and breadth of Africa.

## First stage (2022)
The first stage of the project will be made of three parts to be executed in three years.

   ### 1) NFT MARKET PLACE: 

Unlike most NFT projects that use other market places, AfricMetaverse aims to build and own its own NFT marketplace. This is a very vital first step that will ensure the success of the whole project. This will also add value to token holders who will share in the proceeds of minting fees on the platform, and above all the platform will give AfricMetaverse the leverage to build on all its other phases without interuption.

   ### 2) THE INDOMITABLE LEGENDS:

This will be the pilot and first NFT project to be carried out on the Market place. This pilot project aims to mint bespoke cards and create avatars for football legends that have played on the Cameroonian National team. It aims to capture the relics and glory of the football players that have created a lasting memory in the minds of football lovers worldwide. The success of this has already been secured through MOUs with the FECAFOOT President Mr Samuel Eto’o Fils, as well as with MOUs with other legendary footballers such as Albert Roger Milla, Omah Bilik.  

2 (a): Based on the Success of the Indomitable Legends, we will aim to repeat the same for at least four (4) African countries who must have participated in at least four international competitions after progressing through the qualifiers.  The tournaments they must have participated in will include the African Cup of Nations, The World Cup, The Olympics and The Confederation Cup. 


   ### 3) LEGENDS OF EDEN:
The third part of phase one, will be called the Legends of Eden. This will be the stage at which AfricMetaverse will then show case some of the most prominent figures of African descent. It will be an NFT collection that celebrates prominent figures throughout the history of Africa and Afro-America, Afro-Caribbean, Afro-European etc  From kings and Queens, political and military leaders to sport and science personalities as well as celebrities and actors.

The first stage of this amazing project will be all about creating unique NFTs collectibles that will be used to interact with different events, games, campaigns within the AFricMetaverse. From taking part in sport competitions, to historical, political and military campaigns and a selection of games and projects curated by our community of studios and creatives.


## **Second Stage (2025)**

    • Tournaments and competitions
    • Play to earn
    • Avatars or Metaverse personalities

By 2025 we will be looking at building avatars for all our legends, customizing them to become players and personalities within the AfricMetaverse. Therefore at this stage we will launch a number of competitions and tournaments that will involve the use of all Legends NFT.  NFTs owners will be able to enter these arenas and compete to win their respective Bi-weekly AFER token (AFER) prizes and much more. 

With the above accomplished, we will aim to bring the various legend avatars across the chains to represent the legends they represent on the AfricMetaverse. For example, an Avatar of Roger Mila could become a guest speaker at a football gathering in another metaverse platform or virtual world. So AfricMetaverse will aim to make its NFTs and Avatars rentable or traded between platforms.


## **Third Stage (2027)**
    • Virtual immersion
    • Play to Earn
    • Explore and Learn to Win and Earn

The virtual immersion stage will enable the customization of individual avatars and the VR exploration of key arenas throughout the AFricMetaverse. From exploring amazing geographical and historical locations on the AFricMetaverse to participating in historical events. Users will embark on safaris, expeditions, battles, treasure hunts and much more from the comfort and safety of their home.

### **Scanned 3D Models**
3D scanning capabilities will be provided to individual studios and creatives to support their effort of creating new assets for the EDEN verse.

### **Project Owners**
Real world projects that will be supported and funded by the Foundation in order to enable the creation of more immersive experiences and social impact.


### **Lands, Arenas , Experiences**
